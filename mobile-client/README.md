Trail Tasks: Revolutionizing Productivity for the Outdoor Enthusiast
Trail Tasks is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the gap between productivity and the great outdoors. Leveraging the proven Pomodoro technique, Trail Tasks transforms work sessions into virtual hiking experiences, allowing users to hike through some of the most iconic national park trails in the United States—all while staying productive. Whether you’re working on a project, studying, or simply trying to stay focused, Trail Tasks makes every session an adventure.

Key Features
1. Pomodoro Timer with a Twist
Trail Tasks incorporates a traditional Pomodoro timer, but with a unique twist: as users work, they virtually hike a trail corresponding to real-world distances. The timer starts users at a pace of 2 mph, with their speed increasing every 10 minutes as a reward for sustained focus. This gamified approach to productivity encourages users to stay on task while enjoying the mental escape of a virtual hike.

2. Virtual Hiking Experience
Users can select from a variety of national park trails, each with different lengths and difficulties. As they work, they progress along the chosen trail, gaining distance every 0.01 miles. The realistic simulation keeps users engaged and motivated, turning everyday tasks into rewarding journeys.

3. Trail Tokens & Achievements
Completion of trails earns users trail tokens, which can be used to unlock new trails and other features. Achievements in areas such as session time, miles hiked, and trails completed across various parks and states add a layer of gamification, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

4. Offline & Online Support
Trail Tasks is designed to work seamlessly both offline and online. This ensures that users can continue their productivity journey without interruption, even in areas with limited connectivity. Online functionality enables users to view global leaderboards and compare their miles hiked with others, fostering a sense of community and competition.

5. Detailed Productivity Stats
Users can track their productivity over various time periods and session categories, giving them insight into their work habits and progress. This feature not only helps users stay motivated but also allows them to optimize their workflow for better results.

Park Progression, Prestige, and Levels
Park Levels
Each park tracks a lifetime level, increasing every time a user completes all trails in that park.
Park levels do not reset upon prestige, allowing users to track their lifetime mastery of individual parks.
Example:
Completing all trails in Yosemite three times = Yosemite Level 3.
Park Rewards
Completing all trails in a park earns a park reward (e.g., tokens, badges, achievements).
Rewards can only be redeemed once per prestige.
Upon prestige, park reward redemption resets, allowing users to redeem rewards immediately without rehiking if park completion criteria were already met.
Park Prestige
Reflects a user’s global progress across all parks.
Prestige is earned by completing all parks to the required level.
Upon prestiging:
Park reward redemption resets for all parks.
Prestige level increases, unlocking higher rewards and multipliers.
Trail Rewards
Trails can be hiked repeatedly for individual rewards, no matter if the park has been redeemed.
Workflow Example
Complete all trails in Yosemite → Yosemite Level 1 → Redeem reward.
Complete all trails in Yellowstone → Yellowstone Level 1 → Redeem reward.
Complete all parks → Prestige Level 1.
Prestige resets park rewards; Yosemite Level 2 reward can now be redeemed without rehiking.
