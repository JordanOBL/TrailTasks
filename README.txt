Trail Tasks: Revolutionizing Productivity for the Outdoor Enthusiast
Trail Tasks is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the gap between productivity and the great outdoors. Leveraging the proven Pomodoro technique, Trail Tasks transforms work sessions into virtual hiking experiences, allowing users to hike through some of the most iconic national park trails in the United States—all while staying productive. Whether you’re working on a project, studying, or simply trying to stay focused, Trail Tasks makes every session an adventure.

Key Features
1. Pomodoro Timer with a Twist
Trail Tasks incorporates a traditional Pomodoro timer, but with a unique twist: as users work, they virtually hike a trail corresponding to real-world distances. The timer starts users at a pace of 2 mph, with their speed increasing every 10 minutes as a reward for sustained focus. This gamified approach to productivity encourages users to stay on task while enjoying the mental escape of a virtual hike.

2. Virtual Hiking Experience
Users can select from a variety of national park trails, each with different lengths and difficulties. As they work, they progress along the chosen trail, gaining distance every 0.01 miles. The realistic simulation keeps users engaged and motivated, turning everyday tasks into rewarding journeys.

3. Trail Tokens & Achievements
Completion of trails earns users trail tokens, which can be used to unlock new trails and other features. Achievements in areas such as session time, miles hiked, and trails completed across various parks and states add a layer of gamification, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

4. Offline & Online Support
Trail Tasks is designed to work seamlessly both offline and online. This ensures that users can continue their productivity journey without interruption, even in areas with limited connectivity. Online functionality enables users to view global leaderboards and compare their miles hiked with others, fostering a sense of community and competition.
